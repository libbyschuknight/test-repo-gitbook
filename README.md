# test-repo-gitbook
This is a test repo for trying out gitbook.com

I am trying to figure out how to use gitbook and seeing whether it links to the github repo and makes changes pretty much straight away!

Oh cool, yes it does! Now I need to set one up for kahu-2015 but I think at the moment it is only working with public repos!?!
