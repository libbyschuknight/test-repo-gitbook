# test-repo-gitbook
This is a test repo for trying out gitbook.com

I am trying to figure out how to use gitbook and seeing whether it links to the github repo and makes changes pretty much straight away!

Oh cool, yes it does! Now I need to set one up for kahu-2015 but I think at the moment it is only working with public repos!?!

How easy is it to add a table?

| TITLE | TIME | DAY |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cats  | 12 | Tuesday |
| Dogs  | 9 | Monday |
| Bananas  | 5 | Saturday |
| Chocolate  | 6 | Friday |


| 0:0 | 1:0 |
| -- | -- |
| 0:2 | 1:2 |




| Week |    Time     |    Focus                 |
| -----|:----------: | -----------:|
|  1   | 4:00 - 5:30 | Sexism                   |
|  2   | 4:00 - 5:00 | Inner Critic             |
|  3   | 4:00 - 5:00 | The F Word               |
|  4   | 4:00 - 5:00 | Difficult Conversations  |
|  5   | 4:00 - 5:00 | Triggers                 |
|  6   | 4:00 - 5:00 | Empathy                  |


Yes, tables are pretty easy and it is great seeing the preview updating straight away!!

OH NO! Table isn't working on github repo readme page :(, what have I done wrong

Oh and adding a image! Sweet as easy! Cool!

One issue might be that it doesn't save automatically, this might be an issue as I have gotten very used to things saving automatically!!

Now I just need to figure out how to add other files and link to them.
